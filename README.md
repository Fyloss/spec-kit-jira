# spec-kit-jira

Enterprise Spec Kit ↔ Jira Cloud bridge: mirrors a repository's spec-kit
artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) into Jira as a self-healing,
idempotent, fail-closed bridge. Configurable workflows and hierarchies
(Scrum/SAFe), multi-project routing, Gherkin-rich stories, team-shareable
config. Twin native ports: Bash (macOS/Linux) and PowerShell 7+ (Windows) —
no build step, no download step.

## Install

This repository is a [Spec Kit extension](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/tree/main/extensions).
Install it into a consuming repository with the official Spec Kit command,
which creates `.specify/extensions/jira/` there automatically:

```sh
specify extension add jira --from https://github.com/Fyloss/spec-kit-jira/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
# or, while developing:
specify extension add --dev /path/to/spec-kit-jira
```

Then run the one-command install ceremony in the consuming repository:

```text
/speckit.jira.config
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for prerequisites (Bash ≥ 4 or PowerShell 7+,
`curl`, `jq`, `git`) and credential setup — the API token never enters the
tree, argv, logs, or traces. A bound repository needs **no environment
variables** to mirror specs: the target project, issue type, and priority are
all resolved from `.specify/jira/config.yml` and the discovered binding — see
[INSTALL.md's mirroring step](INSTALL.md#install--configure) for the override
variables that remain supported.

## Repository layout

This is the extension's SOURCE repository, following the official extension
layout: the manifest (`extension.yml`), `commands/`, `scripts/`, and
`templates/` live at the root and are what `specify extension add` copies;
`specs/`, `tests/`, `.specify/`, and `.github/` are development-only and are
excluded from installation by `.extensionignore`.

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `extension.yml` | Manifest — the single source of truth for the version |
| `commands/` | Agent command definitions (`/speckit.jira.config`) |
| `scripts/bash/`, `scripts/powershell/` | The twin ports (module-for-module mirrors) |
| `templates/` | Config scaffold and managed README block template |
| `specs/`, `tests/`, `.specify/`, `.github/` | Development only — never installed |

## Development

The project is built spec-first with Spec Kit itself: the active feature lives
in `specs/001-jira-reconcile-engine/` and the governance rules in
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Both ports are proven behaviourally
equivalent by a language-agnostic conformance corpus (`tests/conformance/`);
`bats` and `Pester` cover each port, with lint (`shellcheck`,
`PSScriptAnalyzer`) and CI gates (engine/sink boundary, module parity,
coverage, single-sourced version) blocking on the three-OS matrix.
