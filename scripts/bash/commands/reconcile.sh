# commands/reconcile.sh — The reconcile command (US3, T059).
#
# Wires the neutral ENGINE to the Jira SINK: it parses a specification into
# neutral content (title ladder, never-empty description, Gherkin, Design,
# priority, estimation), assembles and schema-VALIDATES the neutral document
# (a validation failure blocks every write, Constitution VIII), plans the ordered
# create/update action set, and applies it through the mandatory pre-write BLOCK
# guard (US11 — no write can bypass it). The declared estimation is written on
# create only and never re-sent on update; every created Story carries a readable
# ladder title and a non-empty structured description.
#
# The reconcile-time facts the engine cannot know (base URL, resolved issue-type
# and priority ids, the estimation field id, and existing ticket refs) are
# supplied as a JSON plan context via SPEC_KIT_JIRA_PLAN_CONTEXT — the seam that
# US2/US8 config integration fills from the discovered binding. base_url always
# comes from SPEC_KIT_JIRA_BASE_URL.
